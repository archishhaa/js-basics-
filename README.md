# JavaScript Basics

This repository contains a simple JavaScript code that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. The code covers various basic and advanced topics including variables, functions, loops, conditionals, objects, arrays, higher-order functions, and event handling.

## Features

- **Variables:** Declare and use variables.
- **Functions:** Define and invoke functions.
- **Conditionals:** Use `if-else` statements to make decisions in the code.
- **Loops:** Iterate through numbers and arrays.
- **Objects:** Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
- **Array Methods:** Use array methods such as `forEach()` and `filter()`.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Filter array elements using `filter()`.
- **Event Handling:** Add event listeners and handle events in the browser.

## Code Overview

### Variables
Variables are declared using `let` to store values such as strings, numbers, and booleans.

### Functions
A simple function `greet()` is defined to return a greeting message.

### Conditionals
Conditional statements are used to check if the person is an adult.

### Loops
Loops are used to iterate through numbers and arrays.

### Objects
An object `person` is created with properties and a method.

### Higher-Order Functions
Array elements are filtered using the `filter()` method.

### Event Handling
Event handling is demonstrated by dynamically creating a button and adding a click event listener.

## Getting Started

To run this code:

1. Copy the JavaScript code into a `.js` file or an HTML file within a `<script>` tag.
2. Open the file in a web browser.
3. If using the event handling section, ensure the code runs in an HTML environment.
